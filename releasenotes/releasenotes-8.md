IEVV Opensource 8 beta releasenotes
===================================


8.0.0b1
=======

## What is new

Updated to Django 3.2.x.

Django 3.2 is an LTS version and is expected to receive security updates for at least the next three years from it's initial 
launch (6. April 2024).


## Migrating to ievv-opensource 8.0

- Update your own application for Django 3.2. If you're coming from Django 1.11.x, there are plenty of changes through Django 2 and 3 
  that needs to be addressed (you can migrate directly to Django 3 without going through Django 2 first).
- Check out the documentation for ievv-opensource 7.x (this is the initial Django 3 release) if you're updating from Django 1 or 2.
- Update to ievv-opensource 8.x.
